# Community-Detection-Network-Metrics

This notebook presents a structured analysis of a social network dataset using core Social Network Analysis (SNA) concepts. It walks through loading the network, cleaning the data, and computing fundamental metrics such as centrality, density, degree distribution, and clustering.

It also includes visual exploration of the network graph and identifies key nodes based on different centrality measures. Community detection algorithms are applied to reveal the structure of the network and highlight clusters or influential subgroups.w
